Web page view:
<img width="1870" height="953" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8694bbc-f68d-4c17-b971-3c0e15455e6a" />

I opened the web page and saw a search form. I figured it had something to do with the page's cookies, so I used **browser developer tools** (right-click â†’ Inspect or Ctrl+Shift+I), went to the Application tab, and inspected the cookies section.

Broser developer tools, Application cookies section:
<img width="1870" height="954" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc8d0184-c751-45ed-9a6e-e39ea5dd72c4" />

The cookies section didn't show anythong obvious at first so I went ahead and tried entering a cookie name as suggested by the form placeholder.

Before:
<img width="1080" height="957" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b22c17a-a335-47d6-b772-319c393808b6" />

After:
<img width="1082" height="959" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ebbb3df-9819-4d16-a959-2e2178a7d4da" />

The results

In the HTML source, I found a comment that said:
```html
<!-- The flag is: picoCTF{1nsp3ct_3l3m3nt} -->

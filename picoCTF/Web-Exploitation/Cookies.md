## ðŸ§  Thought Process

Web page view:
<img width="1870" height="953" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8694bbc-f68d-4c17-b971-3c0e15455e6a" />

I opened the web page and saw a search form. I figured it had something to do with the page's cookies, so I used **browser developer tools** (right-click â†’ Inspect or Ctrl+Shift+I), went to the Application tab, and inspected the cookies section.

Broser developer tools, Application cookies section:
<img width="1870" height="954" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc8d0184-c751-45ed-9a6e-e39ea5dd72c4" />

The cookies section didn't show anythong obvious at first so I went ahead and tried entering a cookie name as suggested by the form placeholder.

After:
<img width="1870" height="957" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a6c8c3e-9e1c-4d9d-8615-c88204118f54" />

After submitting the input, I saw the the cookie value changed from -1 to 0, which prompted me to think what happens if I start changing the cookie values and refreshing the page.

After:
<img width="1871" height="956" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3c4ef03-6ddc-48d1-a3c5-d64b79ab5a08" />

After editing the cookie value to 1 and refreshing the page, I noticed the cookie name in the display changed. I then realized the flag is probably hidden in one of the cookie values, and it shouldn't be that far off so I could probably just edit the values manually instead of making a script.

Final Result:
<img width="1871" height="954" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9104cc6d-5855-4c9c-9d9a-2d54b2fb3a34" />

After going all the way up to cookie value 18, in the page view I found:
```html
<!-- Flag: picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be} -->

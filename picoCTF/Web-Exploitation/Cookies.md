## 🧠 Thought Process

### 🔍 Step 1: Initial Observation

Opened the challenge page and found a search form. It seemed likely that the challenge was related to browser cookies.

🧰 Used Developer Tools → Application tab → Cookies section.
<div align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8694bbc-f68d-4c17-b971-3c0e15455e6a" alt="Initial Page View" width="700"/> </div>


### 🍪 Step 2: Inspecting Cookies

Initially, the cookies didn’t show anything obvious.

<div align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc8d0184-c751-45ed-9a6e-e39ea5dd72c4" alt="Cookies Section" width="700"/> </div>

So I tried interacting with the search form.

<div align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06e4849c-75fd-4d76-85ff-1f997ead22a5" alt="Before Interaction" width="700"/> </div>

<div align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a6c8c3e-9e1c-4d9d-8615-c88204118f54" alt="After Interaction" width="700"/> </div>

After submitting an input, the cookie value changed from -1 to 0. That hinted that the cookie value controls the output.


### 🔁 Step 3: Experimenting

I manually edited the cookie value and refreshed the page to see how the page responded.

- Cookie value 0: Default response
- Cookie value 1: New text appeared
- Cookie value 2+: Same pattern

This suggested that the flag might be hidden in one of the cookie states.

<div align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3c4ef03-6ddc-48d1-a3c5-d64b79ab5a08" alt="IDK" width="700"/> </div>


### 🏁 Step 4: Finding the Flag

After increasing the cookie value manually up to 18, the page revealed a HTML page containing the flag:
